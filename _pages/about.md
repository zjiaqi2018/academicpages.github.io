I am a postdoctoral fellow in the school of mathematical and statistical sciences at Clemson University, working with [Timo Heister](http://www.math.clemson.edu/~heister/#home). I completed my PhD at Virginia Tech under the supervision of [Pengtao Yue](https://www.math.vt.edu/people/faculty/yue-pengtao.html).
